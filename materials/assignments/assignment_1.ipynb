If you find that you enjoy working with data and writing computer code, you might want to consider a career in academic research or data science. But what is data science, precisely? To better understand this rapidly-growing field, we would like you to read the following article (which should take about 15 minutes), then answer the questions below. There are no wrong answers, but please respond thoughtfully with 1-3 sentences for each (2 points each).\n","\n","**Article:** \"What is data science?\" *Thinkful.* https://www.thinkful.com/blog/what-is-data-science/.

The article describes how machine learning can be useful for making predictions and identifying relationships in data.
