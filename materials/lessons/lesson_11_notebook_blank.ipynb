These phytoplankton are the primary producers that support a large food web, including krill and the whales that feed on them. Though phytoplankton growth in the Southern Ocean is most often limited by a lack of iron or sunlight, understanding the concentrations of other dissolved macronutrients can still be illuminating for oceanographers. Water samples are analyzed using nutrient autoanalyzers, also known as continuous flow analyzers, to quantify their nutrient concentration. \n","\n","\n"," "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"-fYELJwZSy_o"},"source":["### Coding demonstration"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"QnnxH-28NTXm"},"source":["# Import statements\n","import numpy as np\n","import pandas as pd\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from datetime import datetime\n","\n","# Mount the drive\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"I2IWPG2yO7AJ"},"source":["# Get our filepath\n","\n","# Load the data and display it\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"eISQJttiO_yK"},"source":["# Clean the data\n","\n","# Group and average by date\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"Caq-P0sIPJz9"},"source":["# Create variables for each of the nutrients we are plotting\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"-SrC04J_PtTi"},"source":["# One figure, one axes (multiline plot)\n","\n","# Plotting the lines\n","\n","# Formatting the figure\n","\n","# Creating a legend\n","\n","\n","# Saving our figure\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"CkU4oVAfi6Ly"},"source":["# Do some statistics on our nutrient concentrations (mean, std)\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"bEPfqoPHP-2h"},"source":["# One figure, three axes (subplots) - histograms\n","\n","# Axis 0 - Phosphate\n","\n","# Axis 1 - Silicate\n","\n","# Axis 2 - Nitrite/Nitrate\n","\n","\n","# Saving our figure\n"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"0qxCb0xKQUs1"},"source":["# One figure - bar plot\n","\n","# Creating the bars\n","\n","# Formatting the ticks\n","\n","# Putting text on the plot\n","\n","\n","# Saving our figure"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"4BIIXcFfevjj"},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
