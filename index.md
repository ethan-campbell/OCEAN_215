Welcome to the course website for OCEAN 215, as taught in Autumn 2020 by two graduate students, Ethan Campbell and Katy Christensen. The goal of this course is to **equip undergraduate students to analyze oceanographic data with confidence using the Python programming language**.

OCEAN 215 has been offered since 2015 by Prof. [Stephen Riser](https://environment.uw.edu/faculty/stephen-riser/). In 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, we completely redesigned the course using a flipped, virtual instructional approach. All materials here are original.

On this website, you can find:

- the course [syllabus](about.md),
- information about the [co-instructors](staff.md),
- and a weekly [calendar](calendar.md) with links to videos, slides, activities, assignments, and other resources.

### Evaluation study

*We are currently working on a retrospective study assessing the effectiveness of the course elements and teaching strategies that we used in Autumn 2020. For preliminary results, see our poster and recorded presentation available [here](https://uw.manifoldapp.org/projects/2021-teaching-learning-symposium/resource/cracking-the-code) from UW's Symposium on Teaching and Learning in April 2021. We will be sharing our work virtually at the AGU Fall Meeting in December 2021 (abstract available [here](https://agu.confex.com/agu/fm21/meetingapp.cgi/Paper/998855)). Stay tuned for more!*
