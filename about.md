## Land acknowledgement

We acknowledge that this course is being taught and, for many of us, taken on the unceded traditional lands of Coast Salish peoples, particularly those of the Duwamish Tribe. We are grateful to respectfully live and work as guests on these lands with the Native people who call this home. This land acknowledgement is one small act in the ongoing process of working to be in good relationship with the people of the land and the land itself. An acknowledgment does not take the place of authentic relationships with Indigenous communities. If you are interested in supporting the Duwamish Tribe directly, we suggest visiting this link to Real Rent Duwamish: https://www.realrentduwamish.org.

## Introduction

As your instructors, we recognize that the circumstances presented by the COVID-19 pandemic are challenging and far from ideal. We also understand that each person has a life outside of this course that can impact their education. Your physical well-being and your mental health are the top priorities for this quarter. Do not hesitate to reach out to your instructors (by email, in office hours, or during class) early and often to let us know if you need accommodations or extensions. While we hope that students will do their best to keep up with deadlines this quarter, we will be as flexible and understanding as possible for each person’s circumstance, and we ask that you try to do the same for us. Please treat your colleagues, your instructors, and yourselves with the utmost care; we are all human and we are all in this together.
